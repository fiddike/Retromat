Start with a random principle, discuss what it means and how much need for \
improvement you see, then place it in the middle. \
Pick the next principle, discuss what it means and sort it relatively to the other \
principles. You can propose a position depending on the previous discussion and \
move from there by comparison. \
Repeat this until all cards are sorted. \

Now consider the card on top: This is presumeably the most needed and most urgent \
principle you should work on. How does the team feel about it? Does everyone still \
agree? What are the reasons there is the biggest demand for change here? Should you \
compare to the second or third most important issue again? If someone would now \
rather choose the second position, why?',
