2. **Run Quality Checks**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it retromat-php-fpm-1 sh -c "cd /app/backend && ./quality-checks-in-docker.sh"
   ```
3. **Fix Any Issues** that arise from PHPStan, CS-Fixer, or test failures
4. **Measure Progress**:
   ```bash
   # Extract coverage from output and compare to previous
   # Target: Each step should add 1-8 percentage points
   ```
5. **Document Results** in this file

#### After All Steps:
```bash
# Final verification
docker exec -it retromat-php-fpm-1 sh -c "cd /app/backend && ./quality-checks-in-docker.sh"

## Critical Notes

### Performance Considerations:
- **Test Timeouts:** Current issue with SERP tests timing out after 10 seconds
- **Fixture Loading:** Heavy activity data loading is slow - consider optimization
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor memory consumption during coverage generation

### Test Patterns to Follow:
1. **Authentication:** Use `$this->client->loginUser($testUser)` pattern
2. **Fixtures:** Load minimal required data: `LoadActivityData` + `LoadTeamUsers`
3. **Assertions:** Use flexible assertions for redirects and status codes
4. **Mocking:** Mock external services and file operations
5. **Error Handling:** Test both success and failure scenarios

### Quality Standards:
- All new tests must pass PHPStan analysis
- Code must follow project's CS-Fixer standards
- Test methods must have explicit return type hints (`: void`)
- Use descriptive test method names explaining the scenario

### Troubleshooting:
- **500 Errors:** Usually indicate missing fixtures or service dependencies
- **403 Errors:** Check user roles and permissions in test fixtures
- **Timeout Issues:** Reduce test complexity or increase timeout limits
- **Memory Issues:** Use `php -d memory_limit=2000M` for coverage generation

- âœ… Coverage improvement visible after each step

**Estimated Total Time:** 8-12 hours across all remaining steps
**Priority Order:** Steps 3 â†’ 5 â†’ 6 â†’ 4 â†’ 8 â†’ 7 â†’ 9
