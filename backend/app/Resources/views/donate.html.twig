                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Do you remember time before Retromat?</h2><br>
                When I started out as a Scrum Master in 2010, me and my team did the same retrospective sprint after sprint. We got some value out of it, but failed to have any breakthroughs. Then I read "<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dlret/agile-retrospectives" target="_blank">Agile Retrospectives</a>" and it helped a lot! 
                <br><br>
                With the 5 phases for structure and some activity ideas we started to make headway because we looked at our challenges from a new angle with each retrospective. I started to be on the lookout for new activity ideas. Unfortunately, they were scattered all over the web. My list of bookmarks grew and with them my prep-time before retrospectives, re-reading blog posts to find a good fit. 
                <br><br>
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">A dream... </h2><br>
                It was around this time that I first dreamed of a go-to place containing lots of retrospective ideas. A place to get me started with fresh ideas, so that I could take it from there and tailor it to my team and its situation. Alas, it didn't exist. Until I build it.
                <br><br>
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">... come true!</h2><br>
                The launch version had only 16 activities. I hoped to have 50 activities one day. 100 activities were a VERY ambitious, hazy goal. I honestly didn't think we'd get to the 120+ activities we're at now. And I added all of them on late nights and weekends. That used to be okay, but in October 2014 I became a mom. Since then I don't have late nights anymore (way too tired) and the weekends belong to my little girl. 
                <br><br>
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Money is Time</h2><br>
                That's why I've been slower to add activities. There's a backlog of 30+ exciting activities waiting to be added, plus features like comments and advanced search. I need some dedicated Retromat time and it can't come out of my family time. That's where your donations come in! 
                <br><br>
                Judging from emails and tweets, Retromat is really helpful to a lot of people. If half of them donated what Retromat is worth to them, I could make Retromat that much better! 
                <br><br>
                You probably know the saying "Time is money"? The reverse is also true: "Money is time"! With enough donations, I could take unpaid leave to dedicate time to Retromat. With generous donations I could make it a regular thing.
                <br><br> 
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Has Retromat ever saved the day for you and your team? Does Retromat continue to save you time and give you ideas? Then I'd really appreciate your support!</span>

                <br><br>
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Is this tax-deductible? Are you a charitable entity?
                </h2>
                No to both. Retromat is not a charitable organization and "donations" are not tax-deductible. Sorry!
                <br><br>
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Do I get a receipt of any kind?</h2>
                If you need it just for your own documents, you can <a href="mailto:corinna@finding-marbles.com">email me</a> with the relevant data and I will send you a receipt. <br>
                If you need an invoice to expense at your employer that looks better than a  non-tax-deductible "donation", consider buying <a href="https://leanpub.com/facilitation-1pagers">this book</a> instead of the Paypal route. You can set your own price, I'll get about 70% of it and the book shop takes care of VAT and the invoice.
                <br><br>
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Can I also donate via Bank Transfer?</h2>
                Yes: Corinna Baldauf, IBAN: DE09500310001032818001, BIC / SWIFT: TRODDEF1
                <br><br>
                <h2 style="font-weight: bold">Why donations? Why not Ads / Patreon / ...?</h2>
                I've thought about alternatives, but they all come up short: I hate ads. I’m not sure how I feel about sponsorship, but I’d probably only accept sponsors I genuinely think are good, which limits the possibilities... <br>
                Patreon is a cool concept, but I would have to come up with additional stuff for the Patrons and I can't even keep up the basic Retromat work that I think is crucial...
                <br>That's why I'm trying donations first. With your donation you help keeping Retromat free and ad-free.
